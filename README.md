# React Demo App

This is a sandbox for React components built with Flux.

Required global packages:
`npm i webpack -g;`
`npm i webpack-dev-server -g;`
  
Install local packages at cloned root:
`npm i`

After installing, run webpack-dev-server from cloned root

Your app will be hosted at http://localhost:8080/dest/demo_app.html

## Components

Vote Panel (parent component)
  - Vote Buttons (child component)
  - Vote Count (child component)

## Flux architecture
Components use the Flux pattern for unidirectional data flow. Data flows from stores down to views. Views can only update stores via actions which pass a payload to store methods via the dispatcher.

## Widget architecture
Actions triggered in the views fetch new data via AJAX and flow the response payload through the dispatcher to the store. New data flows from the store down to the React component and state changes trigger the components render method. Each store is responsible for a domain of the application, and only update themselves in response to actions.

Example consuming an external API and flowing response payload through to views:

## Deployment
Widgets will have dedicated CI pulling from Github using Jenkins and should be deployable independent from the API/Application (LC) they consume Jenkins will will also kick off npm, karma and webpack to install dependencies, run unit tests using phantom.js, and compile and package the widget for production.

### React File size
- min+gzip 36k
- min 120k

React's footprint is not completely negligible. One potential solution to mitigating this file size's impact on the customer experience could be to take advantag of React's isomorphic capability to render a flat component, and lazy load the React library based on interaction (clicked help drawer, put focus on search bar, etc)

### Alternatives
React and Flux replace a traditional MVC approach with React representing the view and view-controllers, and Flux handling the models and some controller-like behavior. React and Flux eschew traditional two way data binding in favor of unidirectional data flow. This is the recommended way to use React, however React can be the V in a more traditional MVC with two way data binding as well. 

#### Backbone + react
React just needs to be notified when the model changes, there are existing solutions for this.
- https://github.com/clayallsopp/react.backbone

#### Backbone, underscore, handlebars
This is the traditional backbone approach. IMO this does not provide enough guard rail for an open contribution model.

#### Backbone with Marionette and handlebars, underscore
We could implement the Marionette framework on top of backbone to provide some guard rails and extend backbone features and concepts.

#### Flux w/o React
The flux design isn't dependent on React. We can create our own app dispatcher using the flux base, and build components using a module pattern or similar approach to create component singletons that can talk to eachother via exposed public methods.

#### No frameworks
We aren't bound to using a framework. Another alternative is to write our javascript without a framework. We can take advantage of ES6 features using the Babel transpiler and use module patterns or similar to create our widgets.

#### Need to solve
These were identified as issues we would like to improve on. Below are the issues and their potential solutions if applicable.
- Separate the widget build from LC main application
  * Via independent build strategy. Requires a dedicated build / deploy cycle. More info: Nolan P
- Documentation
  * JSdoc, coverage reporting, release notes
  * TODO env for docs and release notes, automatable 
- Localization
  * Via Yahoo react-intl using format.js http://formatjs.io/react/
- SDK distribution design/Multiple widgets strategy
  * Solved by Reactâ€™s component based design. Components talk to each other via stores built on Flux architecture
- Class naming conventions
  * Solved in React via js interpolation. Solved in LESS/SASS with &- naming convention https://github.intuit.com/TTcom/product-compare-chart/blob/master/src/less/pcc.less
- Better development with watch (only build new files)
  * Solved with web pack watch, and optionally w/ hot reload
- Minified AND compressed production files
  * AWS limitation  
  * TODO, parallel
- ReactJS
  * Yes
- API v2 of LC
  * TODO part of execution
- Implementation design
  * TBD Web components vs Script injection or both? TBD with BU implementation teams
- Manual versioning
  * github tags or via gulp-bump, gulp release, etc
- Documentation for versions
  * Release notes for each version, potentially enforceable https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-release-notes
- sdk-latest
  * TODO, parallel
- sdk-versioned
  * TBD, parallel
- Semantic versioning
  * github tags or via gulp-bump, gulp release, etc
- Monitoring for SDK endpoint uptime
  * TBD, parallel
- Unit testing
  * Karma w/mocha and chai. TBD whats so great about jest?
- Regression testing
  * Unit testing + QE automation TBD
